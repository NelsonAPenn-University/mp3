~~~ Question 1 ~~~

The code smell present in these two functions falls under "Duplicated Code".
We can refactor this by splitting out repeated functionality into its own
function.

~~~ Question 3 ~~~

Because the 'updateAndTrim' function only calls functions on the Jenkins
class, this is an example of feature envy. We can move this function
into the Jenkins class itself.
